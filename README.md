# LinkedList

##
`LinkedList.h` contains the class.

There are operators you can use, such as = and == which are pretty handy.



`main.cpp` just walks through test cases.

`leaker.cpp/h` is a helper to try to catch memory leaks. (Not mine!)

and `pipe.txt` is an unrelated .txt on using pipes in linux.
